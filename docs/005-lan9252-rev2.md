# LAN9252-SPI board, second revision

In the meantime some things to correct were found in first revision of SPI adapter

- Few silkscreens were messed up.
- ESC in TQFP housing would be easier to hand solder. 
- So far there was no situation where EEPROM replacing would be needed. EEPROM can use SMD to shave cost and board size.
- Cheaper RJ45 connectors were found
- Proper separation of chassis ground from device ground with clearance will be needed beyond lab bench stage
- Problem with OUT port, it is treated as network termination - following EtherCAT devices connected there are not detected by master.

Design is ready for order and test, but due to performance benchmark results different approach was selected
